# Token transfer

## Specification 

The contract TokenTransfer allows a user (the *owner*)
to transfer units of a token (possibly, not the native cryptocurrency) to the contract, 
and another user (the *recipient*) to withdraw.

At contract creation, the owner specifies the receiver's address and the token address.

After contract creation, the contract supports two actions:
- **deposit**, which allows the owner to deposit an arbitrary amount of tokens
in the contract;
- **withdraw**, which allows the receiver to withdraw 
any amount of the token deposited in the contract.

## Required functionalities
- Custom tokens
- Transaction revert
  
## Implementation

The token transfer implementation shares the core structure of [simple transfer](https://github.com/broninx/rsc_iota_imp/tree/main/contracts/simple_transfer) but introduces a critical enhancement: a generic type system that extends support to any token type rather than being restricted to IOTA. This modification requires the sender to specify both the recipient address and the token type, which is why the function evolved from set_receiver to set_balance_and_receiver.

### set_balance_and_receiver

```move
public fun set_balance_and_receiver<T>(receiver: address,wallet: Wallet<IOTA>, ctx: &mut TxContext){
    assert!(!wallet.initialized, EPermissionsDenied);
    assert!(ctx.sender() == wallet.owner, EPermissionsDenied);
    let Wallet<IOTA> {id: uid, balance: balance, owner: owner, receiver: _, initialized: _} = wallet; 
    let wallet = Wallet<T>{
        id: object::new(ctx),
        balance: balance::zero<T>(),
        owner: owner,
        receiver: receiver,
        initialized: true
    };
    balance.destroy_zero();
    object::delete(uid);
    transfer::share_object(wallet);
}
```

The set_balance_and_receiver function accepts three inputs:
1. The recipientâ€™s address
2. The wallet instance shared in the smart contract
3. The transaction context

First, it verifies that the `initialized` flag is set to `true` and confirms the transaction sender is the authorized owner of the wallet. If both checks succeed, the function decommissions the original wallet (created during contract deployment) and dynamically generates a replacement wallet. This new wallet retains the original owner but updates the `balance` to reflect the token type specified in the function call, assigns the provided `receiver` address, and resets the `initialized` flag to true. Finally, the system destroys the IOTA token balance and the unique identifier ([UID](https://docs.iota.org/developer/iota-101/objects/uid-id)) of the old wallet and publishes the updated wallet to the contract.
